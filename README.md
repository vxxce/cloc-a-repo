# Cloc a repo

## Description

- Something like the `cloc` or `scc` command line utilities but for analyzing github repositories without needing to clone them first locally.
- Traverses a file tree hosted on GitHub using the GitHub API to analyze\* resources (in memory, no disk writes)

\**Currently far too gracious a word. The "analysis" consists mostly of getting simple character counts. I'm just being optimistic.*
